# WEATHER-PREDICTION-USING-RNN
Weather prediction using RNNs utilizes sequential data, such as temperature and humidity, to predict future conditions. By analyzing past weather patterns, RNNs process temporal dependencies to forecast values like rainfall or temperature, enhancing accuracy in forecasting for agriculture, disaster management, and planning.
